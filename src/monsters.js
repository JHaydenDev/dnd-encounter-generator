      Traits: <p><em><strong>Berserk.</strong></em> Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.</p><p>The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again. </p><p><em><strong>Aversion of Fire.</strong></em> If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. </p><p><em><strong>Immutable Form.</strong></em> The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</p><p> <em><strong>Lightning Absorption.</strong></em> Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.</p><p> <em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. </p><p><em><strong>Magic Weapons.</strong></em> The golem's weapon attacks are magical.</p>,
      Actions: <p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The golem makes two slam attacks. </p><p><em><strong>Slam.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</p>,

The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mouther's next turn.</p>,

      Actions: <p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The devil makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws, and one with its tail. </p><p><em><strong>Bite.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. </p><p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. </p><p><em><strong>Tail.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. </p><p><em><strong>Wall of Ice (Recharge 6).</strong></em> The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.</p><p>When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-­foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.</p>,

      Traits: <p><em><strong>Amphibious.</strong></em> The kraken can breathe air and water. </p><p><em><strong>Freedom of Movement.</strong></em> The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled. </p><p><em><strong>Siege Monster.</strong></em> The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>,
      Actions: <p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling. </p><p><em><strong>Bite.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.</p><p>If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. </p><p><em><strong>Tentacle.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target. </p><p><em><strong>Fling.</strong></em> One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone. </p><p><em><strong>Lightning Storm.</strong></em> The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>,
      Legendary Actions: <p>The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. </p><p><em><strong>Tentacle Attack or Fling.</strong></em> The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling. </p><p><em><strong>Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).</strong></em> The kraken uses Lightning Storm. </p><p><em><strong>Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).</strong></em> While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.</p>,

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.</p><p>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p><p>If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.</p>,

      Traits: <p><em><strong>Innate Spellcasting.</strong></em> The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: </p><p>At will: detect magic, magic missile </p><p>2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep </p><p><em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>,
      Actions: <p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em>(Hag Form Only). <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. </p><p><em><strong>Change Shape.</strong></em> The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies. </p><p><em><strong>Etherealness.</strong></em> The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession. </p><p><em><strong>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).</strong></em> While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.</p>,

      Traits: <p><em><strong>Angelic Weapons.</strong></em> The solar's weapon attacks are magical. When the solar hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 6d8 radiant damage (included in the attack). </p><p><em><strong>Divine Awareness.</strong></em> The solar knows if it hears a lie. </p><p><em><strong>Innate Spellcasting.</strong></em> The solar's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 25). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: </p><p>At will: detect evil and good, invisibility (self only) </p><p>3/day each: blade barrier, dispel evil and good, resurrection </p><p>1/day each: commune, control weather </p><p><em><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong></em> The solar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>,
      Actions: <p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The solar makes two greatsword attacks. </p><p><em><strong>Greatsword.</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage. </p><p><em><strong>Slaying Longbow.</strong></em> <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage. If the target is a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. </p><p><em><strong>Flying Sword.</strong></em> The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If the solar can see the sword, the solar can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to the solar's hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls if the solar dies. </p><p><em><strong>Healing Touch (4/Day).</strong></em> The solar touches another creature. The target magically regains 40 (8d8 + 4) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.</p>,
      Legendary Actions: <p>The solar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The solar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. </p><p><em><strong>Teleport.</strong></em> The solar magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. </p><p><em><strong>Searing Burst (Costs 2 Actions).</strong></em> The solar emits magical, divine energy. Each creature of its choice in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. </p><p><em><strong>Blinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).</strong></em> The solar targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until magic such as the lesser restoration spell removes the blindness.</p>,

The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.</p>,

      Actions: <p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail.

If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20).

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. </p><p><em><strong>Frightful Presence.</strong></em> Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. </p><p><em><strong>Swallow.</strong></em> The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.</p><p>If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>,
      Legendary Actions: <p>The tarrasque can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tarrasque regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p><p><em><strong>Attack.</strong></em> The tarrasque makes one claw attack or tail attack. </p><p><em><strong>Move.</strong></em> The tarrasque moves up to half its speed. </p><p><em><strong>Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).</strong></em> The tarrasque makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.</p>,

      Traits: <p><em><strong>Shapechanger.</strong></em> If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</p><p>While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p><p>While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight. </p><p><em><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong></em> If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. </p><p><em><strong>Misty Escape.</strong></em> When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.</p><p>While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point. </p><p><em><strong>Regeneration.</strong></em> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn. </p><p><em><strong>Spider Climb.</strong></em> The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. </p><p><em><strong>Vampire Weaknesses.</strong></em> The vampire has the following flaws: </p><p><em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. </p><p><em>Harmed by Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water. </p><p><em>Stake to the Heart.</em> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed. </p><p><em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>,
      Actions: <p><em><strong>Multiattack. (Vampire Form Only).</strong></em> The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack. </p><p><em><strong>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18). </p><p><em><strong>Bite. (Bat or Vampire Form Only).</strong></em> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control. </p><p><em><strong>Charm.</strong></em> The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.</p><p>Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. </p><p><em><strong>Children of the Night (1/Day).</strong></em> The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats (swarm of bats, swarm of rats), provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves (wolf) instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.</p>,
      Legendary Actions: <p>The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. </p><p><em><strong>Move.</strong></em> The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. </p><p><em><strong>Unarmed Strike.</strong></em> The vampire makes one unarmed strike. </p><p><em><strong>Bite.</strong></em>(Costs 2 Actions). The vampire makes one bite attack.</p>,
